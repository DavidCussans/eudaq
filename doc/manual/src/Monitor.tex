\section{Writing a Monitor}\label{sec:MonitorWriting}
eudaq::Monitor provides the the base class and common methods to monitor the data quality online. The internal implementation of eudaq::Monitor is very similar to eudaq::DataCollector. The only difference between them is that eudaq::Monitor accepts only a single connection from an eudaq::DataCollector or eudaq::Producer. (not implemented)\\
